   - fix all linter warnings of backend first

   @frontend (nextjs):
      - decide what base image
      - decide what commands (pnpm, turbo; should not need yarn, see TODOs)
   @backend (nestjs):
      - install turbo and pnpm into the container (as for frontend)
      - check other TODOs (should be resolved when frontend is ok)
- docker compose starting frontend, backend containers + db container; could also add reverse proxy (using nginx)    [done]
   docker-compose.yml:
      - prepared for reverse proxy, but for simple setup could go without it
        (requires again new config)
      - testing of setup and improving (check with my (infrastructure - homelab) docker containers)
- docker deployment missing points                                                                                   [done]
   - run db migrations (decide how to do it --> currently 500er error because db not setup)
   - for simplicity configured a drop - create at each application start

- throw away unneeded stuff (web, docs, ui package)                                                                  // TODO

             - better selection algorithm of review items (not just random)                                          [done, first version]

                - review interval, e.g. at 8:00 am
                - number of text snippets to select
             - start cronjob for a newly registered user                                                             [done]

               e.g. do not send an email (maybe only log a warning to console)
          - styling of email, e.g. use proper html (analyse readwise mails)                                          // -
          - time interval, e.g. daily at 8:00 AM; instant send for test                                              // -
          - use a (configurable) Gmail account as the sender                                                         // -
              - could use mailtrap however this only allows to send to your own email address
                (else you need a registered domain)
          - send email to configured email of the user                                                               [done]

      - e.g. organise snippets in blocks
      - have a line below title + author (and above the text)
      - show the "by <author>" in a different color
      - show the "Page <n>" in a different color (e.g. could use same style as for author)
      - Instead of "Here a very cool subheading is written :)" just add a line/ separator
      - heading with version number (optional)
