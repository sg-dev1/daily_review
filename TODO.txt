- Improve config of backend, e.g. to use base config from typescript-config                                          [done]
   - fix all linter warnings of backend first
- Add a shared library project for shared code between frontend and backend (e.g. dtos)                              [done]
- Integrate tanstack query into frontend and establish link to backend                                               [done]
- Dockerfiles for frontend and backend                                                                               [done]

   @frontend (nextjs):
      - decide what base image
      - decide what commands (pnpm, turbo; should not need yarn, see TODOs)
   @backend (nestjs):
      - install turbo and pnpm into the container (as for frontend)
      - check other TODOs (should be resolved when frontend is ok)
- docker compose starting frontend, backend containers + db container; could also add reverse proxy (using nginx)    [done]
   docker-compose.yml:
      - prepared for reverse proxy, but for simple setup could go without it
        (requires again new config)
      - testing of setup and improving (check with my (infrastructure - homelab) docker containers)
- docker deployment missing points                                                                                   [done]
   - run db migrations (decide how to do it --> currently 500er error because db not setup)
   - for simplicity configured a drop - create at each application start

- throw away unneeded stuff (web, docs, ui package)                                                                  // TODO

  - CSV upload (text snippet data)   POST
  - Create new snippet               POST

  - Update data                      PUT/ PATCH
